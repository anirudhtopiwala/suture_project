# suture_project

# Algorithm as discussed

Edge detection

Harris Corner - 2 vertices, high sensitivity

get half plane

get n points on one side suture perpendicular to half plane

apply fofce components o all points 

get displaced points

make new image

repeat



## Tuning Params
Play with the value of MinQuality in detectharris features to change the number of points being generated. The values should be between [0, 1]. Higher values means lesser points.

## Demo Instructions

Run main.m
